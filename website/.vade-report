Vercel Web Analytics Configuration Update

## Summary
Updated the Vercel Web Analytics implementation in the Next.js App Router project to use the recommended import path for Next.js projects.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **app/layout.tsx**: Updated Analytics import path from '@vercel/analytics/react' to '@vercel/analytics/next'
- **package-lock.json**: Updated after running npm install to ensure dependencies are in sync

### Details:
The project already had @vercel/analytics@^1.6.1 installed and the <Analytics /> component properly configured in the root layout file. However, the import was using '@vercel/analytics/react' instead of the recommended '@vercel/analytics/next' path for Next.js App Router projects.

The Analytics component is correctly placed inside the <body> tag after the {children} element, alongside the SpeedInsights component.

## Verification
1. ✅ Dependencies installed successfully (npm install)
2. ✅ Build completed successfully (npm run build)
3. ✅ Linter run (no new errors introduced by these changes)
4. ✅ Lock file updated (package-lock.json)

## Implementation Notes
- This is an App Router project (uses app/ directory structure)
- The Analytics component was already properly integrated; only the import path needed correction
- The recommended import for Next.js App Router is '@vercel/analytics/next' rather than '@vercel/analytics/react'
- The component placement follows best practices: inside <body>, after main content
