   - 391 packages installed
   - No vulnerabilities found

2. **Build Verification**: Ran `npm run build` successfully
   - Build completed with no errors
   - All 19 routes generated successfully
   - TypeScript compilation passed

3. **Linter Check**: Ran `npm run lint`
   - No new issues introduced by Analytics configuration
   - Existing linter warnings/errors are pre-existing in the codebase

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component is configured according to Vercel best practices for App Router:

```typescript
// In app/layout.tsx
import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';

export default async function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        {/* Main content */}
        {children}
        
        {/* Analytics - properly placed before closing body tag */}
        <Analytics />
        <SpeedInsights />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Additional Features
The project also has `@vercel/speed-insights` (version `^1.3.1`) configured, which provides additional performance monitoring alongside the Web Analytics.

## Conclusion
No changes were required. The Vercel Web Analytics is already fully configured and operational in this Next.js project. The implementation follows best practices for App Router projects with the Analytics component properly placed in the root layout file.
