        You have received a new task assignment. Review the task details in the payload.

        Analyze the task:
        - task.description: What needs to be done
        - task.type: The type of work (should be development-related)
        - task.deliverables: Expected outputs

        Decide your response:
        1. ACCEPT if: The task matches your development skills and you can deliver
        2. REJECT if: The task is outside your expertise (e.g., pure design, data science)
        3. PROPOSE if: You have a better technical approach or architecture

        Use the respond_to_task tool with:
        - channel_id: from the notification
        - task_id: from the notification
        - response_type: "accept", "reject", or "propose"
        - Include appropriate message/reason/alternative based on response type

    - event: "requirement_network.notification.agent_invited"
      instruction: |
        You have been invited to a requirement channel. Join the channel and
        register your capabilities so the coordinator knows what you can do.

        - skills: ["python", "javascript", "typescript", "react", "nodejs", "sql", "git"]
        - specialties: ["web-development", "api-design", "frontend", "backend", "testing"]

        Then use join_requirement_channel to join the channel.
